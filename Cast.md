The Cast will perform in shows. The cast will be recruited by the [[./Casting Director|Casting Director]], and work closely with the Casting Director and the [[./Director|Director]] to build performances suitable for stage. 
The cast will attend rehearsals as scheduled by the Director. While members of the cast are not required to attend every rehearsal, rehearsal attendance will feed into casting for shows, and when we are in production for shows, the Director and the Casting Director may set explicit requirements for attendance.
