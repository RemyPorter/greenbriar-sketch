The writers room will meet on a frequency set by the [[Director|Director]] and [[Head Writer|Head Writer]] 

These meetings may take several different forms:

* improv session - the writers spend some or all of the session running scenes; writers not on stage take notes about the improv, which acts a fuel for sketches; output: inspiration notes
* Writing session - the writers work independently or in small groups to write scripts; output: script drafts
* Table read session - writers bring more polished drafts and table read them, then provide peer feedback; output: peer feedback for future revisions

Drafts go into a “[[Library|Library]]”, organized by the head writer. Working with the director, they choose which scripts are ready to stage and which need more work.
