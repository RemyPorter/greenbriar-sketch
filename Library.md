The Library is the collection of sketches produced by Greenbriar. The Library will be organized and managed by the [[./Head Writer|Head Writer]], who will identify scripts that are ready for the stage, and provide feedback to scripts that are not.

Since [[./index|index]] is committed to a collaborative approach to writing and staging, authors may bring sketches to the [[./Writers Room|Writers Room]] *without* submitting it to the library. They may receive feedback, notes, and support from other writers. Sketches which have not been submitted to the library will *not* be staged by Greenbriar.

When a [[sketch|sketch]] is submitted to the Library, the author(s) of that sketch *retain full ownership* of that sketch. By submitting a sketch to the library, [[writers|writers]] grant a non-expiring, non-exclusive, and non-terminating license for [[./index|index]] to edit, modify, and perform that sketch at any point in the future.
