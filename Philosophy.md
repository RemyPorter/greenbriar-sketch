Funny scripts and funny performances are enough to carry a show. Props, costumes, backdrops, and set pieces complicate production and makes shows more stressful. 

Honesty is funny. It’s funnier than being clever. We strive for “truth in comedy” for all of our scripts and all of our performances. 

Burnout is a real risk. We avoid burnout by doing smaller quantities of consistent effort, instead of big dramatic pushes. 

Sketches are sharpened through rehearsal and audience reactions. We want to stage scripts *frequently*. Simpler productions mean we can get sketches off the ground faster and for less money and effort. 

No two performances of a given sketch are truly the same: we will polish sketches through performance. 

[[Rehearsal|Rehearsal]] should be a regular part of our routine. As scripts get written, we should rehearse them and revise them.

Iteration over inspiration. 

No one of us is as smart as all of us. We focus on [[collaboration|collaboration]]. 

[[Improv|Improv]] is a powerful tool to seed sketches. We should write some, if not most, of our sketches starting with improv. 

Performance and writing are skills that feed each other.
